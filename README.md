# **Diwali Sales Data Analysis**

## **Overview**

This project analyzes Diwali sales data to understand customer purchasing patterns based on various demographic factors. The analysis was performed using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. The key findings include insights on customer demographics, popular products, and overall sales distribution across different states.

## **Project Structure**

- **Data**: The project uses a CSV file named `Diwali Sales Data.csv` as the dataset.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Main Analysis**: The notebook covers data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

## **Data Preprocessing**

1. **Loading Data**:

   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas` with proper encoding to handle special characters.

2. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Unnecessary columns such as `Status` and unnamed columns were dropped.
   - Null values were removed.
   - Data types were appropriately changed, especially converting `Amount` to integer type.

3. **Feature Renaming**:
   - Renamed columns for better readability (`Marital_Status` to `Shaadi`).

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Gender**

- **Findings**:
  - Most of the buyers are females.
  - Females have a higher purchasing power compared to males.

### **Age Group**

- **Findings**:
  - The age group 26-35 years is the most active in purchasing, with a significant number of female buyers.

### **State**

- **Findings**:
  - The top three states contributing to the most orders and sales are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.

### **Marital Status**

- **Findings**:
  - Married individuals, particularly women, have a higher purchasing power.

### **Occupation**

- **Findings**:
  - IT, Healthcare, and Aviation are the top occupations contributing to sales.

- **Findings**:
  - The most sold product categories are Food, Clothing, and Electronics.

### **Top Products**

- **Findings**:
  - A detailed analysis of the top 10 most sold products, highlighting the most popular items based on order frequency.

## **Conclusions**

- **Target Audience**:
  - The data indicates that married women aged 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors are the primary buyers.
  - They predominantly purchase products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

## **Usage**

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
2. **Run the Analysis**:
